Q1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep
track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this
assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

A1. It took me about 4 hours to complete this QAP, 1 hour for problem 1, 1 hour for problem 2 and 2 hours for problem 3.

Q2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

A2. I used StackOverflow, MDB documentation, and YouTube.

Q3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention
name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

A3. No I did not.

Q4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did
you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

A4. No I did not.

Q5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and
whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring
some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

A5. The QAP wasn't as difficult as I expected, just alot more work. I would probably be able to complete it as long as I was able to look at outside sources for help.
